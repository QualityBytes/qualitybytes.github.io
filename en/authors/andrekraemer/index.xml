While AppCenter has been a reliable platform for mobile app developers over the years, its upcoming shutdown means it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore new options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our recent &lt;a href="https://www.qualitybytes.de/en/blog/app-center-retirement-what-maui-devs-need-to-know/">blog post on the AppCenter retirement&lt;/a>, we highlighted that there is no single solution available that encompasses all of AppCenter&amp;rsquo;s features—Build, Test, Distribute, Analytics, and Crash Diagnostics. Instead, developers must seek out specialized tools for each function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microsoft App Center is being retired - What .NET MAUI developers need to know now</title><link>https://www.qualitybytes.de/en/blog/app-center-retirement-what-maui-devs-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.qualitybytes.de/en/blog/app-center-retirement-what-maui-devs-need-to-know/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mobile app development is driven by numerous complex infrastructure tasks that typically operate unseen by the end user yet are vital to the app’s quality. These tasks include establishing and managing automated build and deployment processes, conducting tests on real devices, analyzing user data, and capturing detailed diagnostic data when an app crashes on a user device.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="app-center">App Center&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://appcenter.ms">Microsoft Visual Studio App Center&lt;/a> is a cloud-based platform that significantly eases the burden of infrastructure tasks for development teams by offering cloud-hosted services tailored for these needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating users in Azure SQL DB</title><link>https://www.qualitybytes.de/en/blog/creating-users-in-azure-sql-db/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.qualitybytes.de/en/blog/creating-users-in-azure-sql-db/</guid><description>&lt;p>After creating a database under Microsoft Azure, the next step is usually to create a user who is to be authorized in the corresponding database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, there is currently no direct option for this in the web interface of the Azure portal. Only the admin user for the DB server can be configured there. For security reasons, however, this should not be the user with which you later access the database from your own application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reinforcement as Software Developer .NET, Frontend Developer Angular, Xamarin
